Morgan, a physical director of the YMCA club . \\nHe wanted to invent a not -so-strenuous indoor game that businessmen in  the club can \\nplay. Players strike the ball and it volleys among the players, so it was later named \\nVolleyball  by a professor from Springfield College in Massachusetts.  \\nVolleyball  quickly gained popularity among various YMCA branches in the States and it \\nwas subsequently spread to other parts of the world during the World War I by the \\nAmerican troops. Since, it is not a very vigorous sport , women also took interest in the \\nsport and started playing Volleyball.  \\nVolleyball is played by two teams in a rec tangular court, divided into two equal halves \\nacross the length by a net tightly stretched between two poles fixed at either sides of the \\ncourt. It is one of most popular rally games and is today widely played across the world.  \\nThe objective o f the game is to try to make the ball touch the ground  on the opponent  \\nside. When the ball is hit by a team , the members of other team hit it with their hands  to \\nprevent it from touching the ground and to send it to another teammate or to the other \\nside of the court  across the net . Only three players from the team can strike the ball \\nsuccessively  before they send it to the other team.   \\nVolleyball allows players to pass the ball among teammates li ke basketball, but the \\nstrategies of defending and attacking are similar to other net or racquet games.  Players \\ntry to shoot the ball over the net at the opponent  side where it is tough for the opponents \\nto volley it . The players of both teams have to prevent ball touching the ground  thus \\npreventing the opponent to gain points . \\nTeam Size  \\nVolleyball is played among two teams of six players each.  A team may also have six more \\nsubstitute players. One of the pla yers is team c aptain and one of them is Libero . Players \\nare positioned in two rows of three players each. The Libero is identified with a dress \\ndifferent from other team members. He is a specialist in defending  and cannot serve or \\nmove to the front court. \\nThe team captain along with the coach is responsible for  maintain ing discipline in the team. \\nThe team captain also represents the team and speaks about their team members \\nconcerns.  \\nDuring competition , each team has a coach, one or two assistant coac hes, a \\nphysiotherapist and a doctor. These members sit along with substitute players on their \\nteam bench outside free zone.  \\nParticipating Countries  \\nAs volley ball originated in the United States, it is very popular there . The game has spread \\nto other s urrounding countries  and Europe . The game is simple, quick, entertaining and \\ndoes not require much equipment .  \\nMany times in world championships, a new team surprisingly emerges as a top contender \\nand proves th at good coaching facilities and good practice can make good players.  1.
